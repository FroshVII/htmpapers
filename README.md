### [A Theory of How Columns in the Neocortex Enable Learning the Structure of the World][1]
This paper proposes a network model composed of columns and layers that performs robust object learning and recognition. The model introduces a new feature to cortical columns, location information, which is represented relative to the object being sensed. Pairing sensory features with locations is a requirement for modeling objects and therefore must occur somewhere in the neocortex. We propose it occurs in every column in every region.

### [The HTM Spatial Pooler â€“ a neocortical algorithm for online sparse distributed coding][2]
This paper describes an important component of HTM, the HTM spatial pooler, which is a neurally inspired algorithm that learns sparse distributed representations online. Written from a neuroscience perspective, the paper demonstrates key computational properties of HTM spatial pooler.

### [Evaluating Real-time Anomaly Detection Algorithms - the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark][3]
14th IEEE ICMLA 2015 - This paper discusses how we should think about anomaly detection for streaming applications. It introduces a new open-source benchmark for detecting anomalies in real-time, time-series data.

### [Unsupervised Real-Time Anomaly Detection for Streaming Data][4]
This paper demonstrates how Numenta's online sequence memory algorithm, HTM, meets the requirements necessary for real-time anomaly detection in streaming data. It presents results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), the first open-source benchmark designed for testing real-time anomaly detection algorithms.

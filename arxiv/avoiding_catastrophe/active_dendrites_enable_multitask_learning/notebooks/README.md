Notebooks are included for reference only, showing results and several explorations. They are not required to reproduce the project.

If you want to run them,  be mindful of broken imports: please change references to `nupic.embodied.multitask` to only `main`. It might be required to use additional classes and functions from [nupic.research](https://github.com/numenta/nupic.research)
